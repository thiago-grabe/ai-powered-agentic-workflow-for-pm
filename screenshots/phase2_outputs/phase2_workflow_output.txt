Defining workflow steps from the workflow prompt

Workflow Steps Identified (1 steps):
  1. The development tasks for a product typically involve breaking down each user story into specific engineering tasks that need to be completed to implement the functionality described in the story. These tasks can include things like coding, testing, design work, documentation, and any other activities necessary to deliver the feature.

 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
The development tasks for a product typically involve breaking down each user story into specific engineering tasks that need to be completed to implement the functionality described in the story. These tasks can include things like coding, testing, design work, documentation, and any other activities necessary to deliver the feature.
Worker Agent Response:
Development tasks are defined by identifying what needs to be built to implement each user story. This involves breaking down the user story into specific engineering tasks such as coding, testing, design work, documentation, and any other activities necessary to deliver the feature.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No, the provided answer does not meet the criteria. The answer does not include a Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, or Dependencies. It provides a general overview of development tasks without the specific structure required.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the incorrect answer, the worker agent should follow these instructions:

1. Include a Task ID: Assign a unique identifier to the task for tracking purposes.
2. Task Title: Clearly state the title of the task to provide a concise description.
3. Related User Story: Link the task to the corresponding user story or requirement.
4. Acceptance Criteria: Define the specific conditions that must be met for the task to be considered complete.
5. Estimated Effort: Provide an estimate of the time or resources required to complete the task.
6. Dependencies: Identify any dependencies or prerequisites that need to be addressed before starting the task.

By incorporating these elements into the answer, the worker agent will provide a more structured and comprehensive response that aligns with the requirements.
 Step 5: Send feedback to worker agent for refinement

--- Interaction 2 ---
 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
The original prompt was: The development tasks for a product typically involve breaking down each user story into specific engineering tasks that need to be completed to implement the functionality described in the story. These tasks can include things like coding, testing, design work, documentation, and any other activities necessary to deliver the feature.
The response to that prompt was: Development tasks are defined by identifying what needs to be built to implement each user story. This involves breaking down the user story into specific engineering tasks such as coding, testing, design work, documentation, and any other activities necessary to deliver the feature.
It has been evaluated as incorrect.
Make only these corrections, do not alter content validity: To fix the incorrect answer, the worker agent should follow these instructions:

1. Include a Task ID: Assign a unique identifier to the task for tracking purposes.
2. Task Title: Clearly state the title of the task to provide a concise description.
3. Related User Story: Link the task to the corresponding user story or requirement.
4. Acceptance Criteria: Define the specific conditions that must be met for the task to be considered complete.
5. Estimated Effort: Provide an estimate of the time or resources required to complete the task.
6. Dependencies: Identify any dependencies or prerequisites that need to be addressed before starting the task.

By incorporating these elements into the answer, the worker agent will provide a more structured and comprehensive response that aligns with the requirements.
Worker Agent Response:
Development tasks are defined by identifying what needs to be built to implement each user story. This involves breaking down the user story into specific engineering tasks such as coding, testing, design work, documentation, and any other activities necessary to deliver the feature. To provide a more structured and comprehensive response, the following elements should be included for each development task:

1. Task ID: DT001
2. Task Title: Implement User Authentication Functionality
3. Related User Story: As a user, I want to be able to securely log in to the application to access my account information.
4. Acceptance Criteria: 
   - User should be able to enter their username and password.
   - System should validate the user credentials against the database.
   - Upon successful validation, user should be granted access to their account.
5. Estimated Effort: 8 hours
6. Dependencies: Completion of database setup for user credentials storage.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
Yes, the answer meets the criteria provided. It includes all the required elements for each development task as outlined in the structure provided. The answer is well-structured and provides detailed information for each task.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
âœ… Final solution accepted.
