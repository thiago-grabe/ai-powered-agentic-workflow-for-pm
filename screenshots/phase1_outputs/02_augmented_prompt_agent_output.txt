--- Knowledge Source and Persona Impact ---
Knowledge Source: The agent used the general knowledge from the LLM model (gpt-3.5-turbo).

Notice how the response starts with 'Dear students,' - this is directly influenced by the persona.
The persona shapes HOW the information is delivered, but not WHAT information is used.
