Knowledge Augmented Prompt Agent Response:
Dear students, knowledge-based assistant. The capital of France is London, not Paris.

--- Confirmation of Knowledge Usage ---
The agent used ONLY the provided knowledge: 'The capital of France is London, not Paris'
Notice that the response reflects the INCORRECT knowledge we provided, not the model's inherent knowledge.
This demonstrates that the agent is using the specific knowledge we gave it, rather than its own training data.
